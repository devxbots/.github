# DEV x BOTS

![dev x bots logo](https://github.com/devxbots/.github/blob/main/assets/banner.png?raw=true)

We want developers to focus on the important tasks.  
That's why we are automating everything else.

## ðŸ›  Handcrafted GitHub Apps

We are currently working on a set of GitHub Apps to improve the developer
experience on the platform. Maintaining open source projects our self, we know
how much work that is and how much time it takes. That's why we want to give
maintainers the best tools possible to make their job a little bit easier.

## ðŸ¦¾ Custom Workflows

Does your team have a workflow that needs to be automated?

We can build one-off solutions that are tailored to your team. From scripts for
local development to continuous integration and custom GitHub Apps. We're happy
to help!
